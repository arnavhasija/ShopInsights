# ShopInsights
Explore customer preferences with e-commerce trends data. Uncover demographics, purchase history, and consumer choices to optimize marketing and boost satisfaction, which could help reshape how businesses connect with their audience.

<h2>Introduction:</h2>

In this exploration, I will delve into the fascinating realm of consumer behavior and shopping habits using a rich dataset sourced from C. Okan Sakar and Yomi Kastro's paper, "Real-time prediction of online shoppersâ€™ purchasing intention using multilayer perceptron and LSTM recurrent neural networks."

<h2>Background and Motivation:</h2>

Understanding customer preferences is paramount in today's dynamic market. The dataset, comprising 12,330 customer sessions over a year (excluding holidays, special days, or campaigns), serves as a compass in navigating the intricacies of online shopping. With 10 numerical and 8 categorical variables at  my disposal, I aim to unravel the underlying patterns that shape purchasing decisions.

Through this project, I aim to embark on this journey to decode real-time predictions of online shoppers' purchasing intentions. My motivation lies in leveraging this comprehensive dataset to glean insights that can revolutionize marketing strategies, optimize product offerings, and enhance overall customer satisfaction. I plan to explore the nuances of consumer behavior and transform raw data into actionable insights that redefine the way businesses connect with their audience.
